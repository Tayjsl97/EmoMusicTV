# EmoMusicTV
This is the official implementation of EmoMusicTV, which  is a transformer-based variational autoencoder (VAE) that contains a hierarchical latent variable structure to explore the impact of time-varying emotional conditions on multiple music generation tasks and to capture the rich variability of musical sequences.
